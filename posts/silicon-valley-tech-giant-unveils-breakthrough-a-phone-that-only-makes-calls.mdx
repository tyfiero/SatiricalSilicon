In a shocking turn of events, a Silicon Valley tech giant has unveiled their latest breakthrough: a phone that only makes calls. That's right, folks. No more mindless scrolling, no more constant notifications, and no more Candy Crush. Just good old-fashioned phone calls.

The announcement was met with a mix of disbelief and sheer joy from smartphone users worldwide, who have long been held captive by the tyranny of social media, apps, and constant notifications. "I can finally have a conversation without being interrupted by a barrage of memes and cat videos," said one relieved user.

The new phone, dubbed the "CallMeMaybe," features a sleek design with a single button for dialing and a small screen that displays the number you're calling. It's a revolutionary step back in time, and users are loving it.

"I never thought I'd see the day when I could use my phone without feeling the crushing weight of FOMO," said another ecstatic user. "Now I can actually focus on the person I'm talking to, instead of worrying about what I'm missing out on."

The CallMeMaybe is expected to hit shelves later this year, and experts predict it will be a game-changer in the tech industry. As one analyst put it, "This is the beginning of a new era in communication. A return to simplicity, and a much-needed break from the chaos of modern life."

So, if you're tired of being a slave to your smartphone, keep an eye out for the CallMeMaybe. It just might be the answer to your prayers.
