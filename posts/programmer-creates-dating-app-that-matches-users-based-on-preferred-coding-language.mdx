In a world where dating apps are a dime a dozen, one programmer has taken it upon himself to create the ultimate niche dating platform: CodeMance, an app that matches users based on their preferred coding language.

Tired of swiping left on potential partners who couldn't tell a Python from a Java, the app's creator, John "CodeMaster" Smith, decided to take matters into his own hands. "I was tired of going on dates with people who didn't understand the beauty of a well-structured for loop," he lamented. "I needed to find someone who shared my passion for code."

CodeMance users are required to list their preferred coding languages in their profiles, with options ranging from the ever-popular Python and Java to the more obscure Haskell and Brainfuck. The app then uses a proprietary algorithm to match users with similar coding preferences, ensuring that the only thing standing between them and true love is a heated debate over the merits of functional programming.

The app has already garnered a cult following among the programming community, with many users praising its ability to filter out potential partners who still cling to the outdated notion that PHP is a viable coding language. "I can't tell you how many times I've been on a date with someone who started talking about PHP like it was the second coming of Christ," said one satisfied user. "CodeMance has saved me from countless awkward conversations."

While the app has been a hit among the coding community, some critics argue that it perpetuates the stereotype that programmers are socially awkward individuals who can only connect with others through their shared love of code. To these critics, Smith simply responds, "Have you ever tried to explain the intricacies of a well-designed API to someone who doesn't code? It's a nightmare."

As CodeMance continues to gain traction, it seems that love truly is in the air for programmers everywhere. And who knows? Maybe one day, we'll all find our perfect match based on our preferred coding language.
