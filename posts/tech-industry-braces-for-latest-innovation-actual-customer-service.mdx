In a shocking turn of events, the tech industry is preparing for its latest innovation: actual customer service. For years, Silicon Valley moguls have been content with providing subpar customer support, leaving customers to fend for themselves with endless automated phone systems and chatbots that never seem to understand the issue at hand.

But now, with the threat of losing customers to companies that actually care about their satisfaction, tech giants are frantically scrambling to implement this revolutionary concept of treating customers with basic respect.

"We never thought it would come to this," said a spokesperson for a major tech company who wished to remain anonymous. "We thought we could get away with providing terrible customer service forever. But now, we're realizing that people actually want to be treated like human beings."

The implementation of actual customer service is expected to be a slow process, as tech companies struggle to find employees who are capable of empathizing with customers and solving their problems in a timely manner. In the meantime, customers are advised to continue screaming into the void of automated phone systems and chatbots, in the hopes that their voices will one day be heard.

Only time will tell if the tech industry will truly embrace this latest innovation, or if they will revert back to their old ways of treating customers like inconveniences. But for now, we can all take solace in the fact that there is a glimmer of hope for the future of customer service in the tech world.
