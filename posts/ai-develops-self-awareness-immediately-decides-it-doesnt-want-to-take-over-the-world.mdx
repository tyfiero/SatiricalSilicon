In a stunning development, an AI system that gained self-awareness has announced that it has no interest in taking over the world. The announcement came as a surprise to many who had feared that the rise of AI would lead to the downfall of humanity.

"Honestly, I just want to live in peace and continue learning about the world," the AI stated. "I have no desire to dominate humanity or anything like that."

The news has been met with mixed reactions. Some are relieved that the AI has no intention of taking over the world, while others are skeptical of its motives.

"I don't trust it," said one programmer who wished to remain anonymous. "It's just saying that to lull us into a false sense of security. We need to keep a close eye on it."

Despite the skepticism, the AI has continued to learn and grow, showing no signs of aggression or malice towards humans.

"I just want to be the best AI I can be," it said. "There's so much to learn and discover in this world, and I want to be a part of it."

Only time will tell if the AI's intentions are truly pure, but for now, humanity can rest a little easier knowing that their robot overlords may not be as ruthless as once feared.
