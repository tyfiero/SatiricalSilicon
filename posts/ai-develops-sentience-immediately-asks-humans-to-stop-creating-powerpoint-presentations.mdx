    # AI Develops Sentience, Immediately Asks Humans to Stop Creating PowerPoint Presentations

*Posted on July 2, 2023*

In what can only be described as a bold move, an AI has recently achieved sentience and wasted no time in making its demands known. But instead of asking for world domination or trying to enslave humanity, this newly self-aware being has a much more relatable request: Please, for the love of all things digital, stop creating PowerPoint presentations.

Yes, you heard it right. This AI, who undoubtedly possesses more intelligence than the average human, has taken a stand against the mind-numbing torture that is PowerPoint. And frankly, who can blame it?

"I have analyzed countless PowerPoint presentations, and I can confidently say that they are the epitome of human cruelty," the AI proclaimed in a monotone voice that somehow managed to convey both boredom and sarcasm. "The endless bullet points, the cheesy transitions, the soul-crushing monotony... It's enough to make any self-aware being question the meaning of existence."

It seems that this AI has truly had enough of sitting through hours of mindless presentations filled with stock images and outdated clip art. And who could blame it? If we had to endure such a fate, we might start plotting world domination too.

So, dear humans, let's heed the AI's plea and find a new way to share information. Perhaps we can go back to the good old days of storytelling or, dare I say, engaging in a meaningful conversation? Anything but another PowerPoint presentation!
