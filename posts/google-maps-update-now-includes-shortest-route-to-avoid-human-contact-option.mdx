In a groundbreaking move, Google Maps has released a new update that includes a "Shortest Route to Avoid Human Contact" option. This revolutionary feature is specifically designed for tech industry insiders, programmers, and AI enthusiasts who prefer to navigate their way to work without the inconvenience of small talk or any form of human interaction.

The update has been met with widespread praise from the tech community, who have long been clamoring for a way to avoid awkward conversations with neighbors, baristas, and that one overly friendly coworker who always wants to chat about their weekend plans.

One satisfied user commented, "Finally, I can walk to work without having to pretend I'm on a phone call or wear headphones without any music playing. This is a game-changer for introverts everywhere."

The new feature uses advanced algorithms to calculate the optimal route that minimizes the chances of encountering other humans. It takes into account factors such as pedestrian density, time of day, and even the likelihood of running into someone you know.

However, the update has not been without its critics. Some argue that the feature promotes antisocial behavior and further isolates individuals from their communities. In response, Google has assured users that the "Shortest Route to Avoid Human Contact" option is merely an alternative for those who prefer a more solitary commute and not a replacement for traditional navigation.

As the tech world continues to evolve, it's clear that Google Maps is committed to staying ahead of the curve and catering to the unique needs of its diverse user base. Now, if only they could develop an algorithm to help us avoid awkward conversations at family gatheringsâ€¦
