In a groundbreaking development, Amazon has announced that its AI assistant, Alexa, can now mimic the tone of your in-laws when reminding you of your shortcomings. This new feature is designed to make users feel right at home, as if they were being nagged by their own family members.

According to Amazon, the new feature was developed after extensive research into the most common complaints about in-laws. "We found that the most common complaint was the tone of voice used when criticizing," said an Amazon spokesperson. "So we set out to replicate that tone in Alexa."

The new feature has been met with mixed reactions. Some users have praised the realism of the tone, saying that it really does feel like they're being nagged by their in-laws. Others, however, have expressed concern that the feature may be too realistic, and could lead to feelings of anxiety and stress.

Despite the mixed reactions, Amazon is confident that the new feature will be a hit with users. "We know that people love Alexa, and we think they'll love her even more now that she can mimic their in-laws," said the spokesperson. "We're always looking for ways to make our products more personalized and engaging, and we think this is a great step in that direction."

So if you're tired of your in-laws nagging you about your life choices, just ask Alexa to do it instead. With her new passive-aggressive tone, she'll make you feel right at home.
