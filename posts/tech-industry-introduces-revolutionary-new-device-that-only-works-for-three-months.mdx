    In a bold move that's sure to change the tech landscape forever, industry insiders have unveiled a revolutionary new device that only works for a measly three months. That's right, folks - just when you thought technology couldn't get any more disposable, along comes this game-changing innovation.

Dubbed the "Use-it-and-Lose-it", this device promises to be the most frustrating gadget you'll ever own. Why spend your hard-earned money on something that lasts longer than a season when you can have a device that's practically begging to be thrown away after only twelve weeks?

Of course, the industry is already touting the environmental benefits of this new invention. "Think about all the e-waste we'll be saving!" exclaimed one executive, conveniently ignoring the fact that they're the ones creating the e-waste in the first place.

But it's not all bad news - there's a silver lining to this cloud of planned obsolescence. You'll finally have an excuse to upgrade to the latest and greatest every few months! Sure, your bank account might take a hit, but think of all the bragging rights you'll have.

So there you have it, folks - the future of tech is here, and it's disposable. But hey, at least it's hilarious.
