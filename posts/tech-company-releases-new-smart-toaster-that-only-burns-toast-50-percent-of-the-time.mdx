    In the latest tech news, a company has released a new smart toaster that only burns toast 50% of the time. Finally, the thrill of playing Russian Roulette has been brought to breakfast time!

"We wanted to give our customers the excitement of not knowing whether their toast will be perfectly golden or completely charred," said the CEO of the tech company. "It's all about adding some adrenaline to the most important meal of the day."

The new smart toaster uses advanced AI algorithms to determine the perfect level of toasting for each individual slice of bread. But there's a catch - the algorithm has a 50% chance of being wrong. Will your toast be crispy and delicious or burnt to a crisp? Who knows!

Some customers have already reported feeling more alive in the morning, eager to see what fate has in store for their breakfast. "I used to dread making toast in the mornings," said one satisfied customer. "But now, it's like a game! Will I get lucky today?"

It seems like this new smart toaster is not only revolutionizing breakfast, but also adding some much-needed excitement to our daily routines. Who knows what other thrilling kitchen appliances the future holds?
